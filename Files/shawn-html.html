            <p>
                Hey there! I'm Shawn David, a Grade 12 First City Providential College student. I'm diving deep into the exciting world of ICT-CSS (Information and Communication Technology â€” Computer Systems Servicing).
                <br><br>
                As an Intelligent and Persevering FCPCian, I'm constantly immersed in the dynamic atmosphere of learning and innovation. It's what sparked my interest in computers and everything they can do. From troubleshooting to software development, I'm eager to learn it all and carve out my path in the digital realm.
                <br><br>
                When I'm not engrossed in bits and bytes, I often unwind with my favourite tunes or catch up on the latest blockbuster hits. Music and movies are my go-to escapes, offering a welcome break from the complexities of coding and hardware.
                <br><br>
                But amidst all the tech and entertainment, nothing beats the simple joys of spending time with my loved ones. Whether it's sharing a meal or hanging out, family and friends are the actual anchors in my life.
                <br><br>
                Join me as I navigate the challenges and triumphs of Grade 12 ICT-CSS. Together, let's explore the endless possibilities technology offers and make memories along the way.<br><br>

                This morning she skipped breakfast, said she was running late<br>
				Her actions turning reckless, she began making mistakes<br>
				And I noticed something off about her cadence yesterday<br>
				She didn't even notice that she called me by his name<br>

            <p>
                Half of my heart wants what we had again (we can, we can)<br>
				Falling apart thinkin', "What could've been?"<br>
				Don't make it harder than it has to be<br>
				Baby, please, I don't think we can be friends<br>
				(I don't think we can, we can)<br><br>
				I just wanna stop, had enough, out of love and out of luck<br>
				I don't wanna give a fuck about my feels, dozin' off<br>
				Emotionally uninvested, resting for the day to come<br>
				Try my hardest not to run away from everything I've done<br>
				But I'm looking back, ignoring facts<br>
				I see two moons but walk six paths<br>
				Inside my head, I'm going mad for you<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                I never asked why, and I never did cry<br>
				I never told another how I felt inside<br>
				Demons don't hide when I'm dreaming at night<br>
				And I won't mislead you, you'll miss me<br>

            <h4>Understand</h4>
            <p>
                Girl, I hope you understand I<br>
				Wanted to hold your hand, but I can't<br>
				Wanted to be your man back then<br>
				And you knew I fell for you, but you<br>
				Just broke my heart in two<br>
				I was sad, mad, and broken on my bed<br>
				Hoping I get rid of all the voices in my head<br><br>
				Girl, I hope you understand I<br>
				Wanted to hold your hand, but I can't<br>
				Wanted to be your man back then<br>
				And so far I never held you with my arms<br>
				So it's hard to be the one you aren't with<br>
				Instead, filled with anxiety<br>
				Always was a part of me, guess I'm not cut out to be<br><br>
				Girl, I hope you understand I<br>
				Wanted to hold your hand, but I can't<br>
				Wanted to be your man back then<br>
				And you had known and played along, you<br>
				Were my home, I wrote you songs<br>
				Now you're dead to me, effectively<br>
				Removed yourself outside my dreams<br>
